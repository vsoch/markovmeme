## What is the RSE Glossary?

This is a small, fun project to attempt to distinguish a namespace of common
terms relevant to research software engineering from traditional software engineering.
If you see a lot of overlap between those two, you are correct! Many practices 
from traditional software engineering fall nicely within research software
engineering, however the overlap isn't perfect, and further, the context 
may be different. There are also likely expressions, conferences, or other
terminology that are distinct to this space. For this reason, we've 
established this site of terms to assert these differences.

## How do I contribute?

You can edit or add a new term by editing the [_data/terms.yml](_data/terms.yml)
file. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://www.github.com/rseng/rse-glossary/issues).
